Installation:

1) Copy files to any preferred  directory
2) Type make

If make raises an error please make sure the compiler is recent. If an error still occurs this may be because the compiler does not support threading. In this case, a non-threaded version of VarHMM can be made by renaming varhmm_nothread.cpp to varhmm.cpp and typing make. 

Run:

Type varhmm to get help menu for alignment
Type varhmmtain to get help menu for training
